Example:
```stayzia
struc. Point [ x: i32, y: i32 ]
fn. calculate distance [ p1: Point, p2: Point ] i32
    dx = p2.x - p1.x
    dy = p2.y - p1.y
    return sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
endfn
```

#### 2. **Seamless Interpretation and Compilation**
Stayzia offers two distinct modes of execution: interpretation and compilation. The developer can opt to run code in real-time using the **StayziaInterpreter** for rapid prototyping or debugging, or they can use the **StayziaCompiler** to compile their code into C++ for performance-critical applications. This flexibility allows developers to iterate quickly in the early stages of development and optimize later for production environments.

### Key Features of Stayzia

1. **Natural Language Syntax (Code That Reads Like English)**  
   Stayzia’s syntax is designed to be as simple as possible. The code looks almost like regular English sentences, so you can quickly understand what it’s doing. This makes writing, fixing, and improving your programs faster and less frustrating.

   Example code:
   ```stayzia
   struc. Point [ x: i32, y: i32 ]
   fn. calculate distance [ p1: Point, p2: Point ] i32
       dx = p2.x - p1.x
       dy = p2.y - p1.y
       return sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
   endfn
   ```
   *Translation: This code defines a structure for a point and a function that calculates the distance between two points.*

2. **Interpretation and Compilation (Run Code Fast or Make It Fast)**  
   Stayzia can either run code instantly for quick testing (interpretation) or compile it into a highly optimized form (using C++). You can start by running code in real time and later convert it to a faster form for production.
